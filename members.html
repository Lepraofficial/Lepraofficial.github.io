                <h1>In the beginning...</h1>
                <img src="">
                <p>Tale as old as time itself, Lepra began as a high school band made up of four kids going to the
                    same school that each knew how to play an instrument and wanted to jam. Even before the band had settled on their name,
                    they had a myriad of lineup changes, and the only constant members
                    were Josip and Dario. With the arrival of Adin they finally had their first stable lineup with Luka Vidović on the Drums.
                    <br>For a while they had worked on their first couple of covers: Slayer - Black Magic, Venom - Don't Burn The Witch,
                    Metallica - For Whom The Bell Tolls, Black Sabbath - Paranoid ...<br> It didn't take long for the band to start writing original songs: Kill'em, Thrash All Night and Lepra.

                <h1>Coming of Age</h1>
                <img src="">
                <p>"We played our first gig at AG Club in Sarajevo 02.10.2020 with three other bands: Srklet, Inercija and Kolektivna šteta.
                    After we played our first show, the ecstacy of performing overwhelmed us and we knew we had to
                    record the songs that the crowd went crazy for. Luckily for us, our friend Faruk Tufo offered to record and mix our first
                    EP, and so it was. Not long after our debut gig we had recorded and released the first couple of songs we wrote and
                     <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHa1UZfEkj8" target="_blank">published them
                        on 27.11.2020.</a> 
                    Recording the EP made us realise that playing with Luka wasn't going to work out so we started looking for a replacement.
                    A while later, the pandemic halted all of our plans and we were unable to play for a while. Once things started to normalize, we wasted no time
                    in getting back together with a new force behind the drumset - Omar Operta."</p>
