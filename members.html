                <h1>The beginning</h1>
                <img src="">
                <p>As so many bands before us Lepra started as an unnamed Highschool band, made up of four kids going to the
                    same school that each knew how to play an instrument and wanted to start something. Before we even had a name
                    we had a couple members leave and join the band,and the only members who remained in the band the entire time
                    were Josip and Dario. With the arrival of Adin we finally had our first stable team with Luka Vidović on the Drums
                    <br>For a while we worked on our first couple of covers: including Slayer-Black magic, Venom- Don't burn the witch,
                    Metallica- For whom the bell tolls, Black Sabbath- Paranoid and more.<br> Not long after came our first original
                    songs: Kill'em, Thrash all night and the self titled song.
                </p>

                <h1>Coming of Age</h1>
                <img src="">
                <p>We played our first gig at AG club in Sarajevo 02.10.2020 with four other bands: Srklet, Inercija and Kolektivna šteta.
                    After we played all these songs live the ecstasy of playing live hit our heads hard and we knew we had to
                    record the songs that the crowd went crazy for and luckily our friend Faruk Tufo offered to record and mix our first
                    EP, and so it was. not long after our debut gig we had recorded and released our first couple songs and published them
                    on 27.11.2020.
                    Recording with Tufo made us realise that playing with Luka wasn't going to work out so we started looking for a replacement.
                    A while later Covid-19 wrecked havoc and we were unable to play for a while but when it started to calm downr we wasted no time
                    in getting back together with a new force behind the drumset- Omar Operta.</p>
